# Go-Enjin Example Projects

This repository contains a number of example codebases. All of these projects
are intended to be very simple examples of using particular features or other
interesting aspects of working with Go-Enjin in general.

## Commands (cmd)

The `cmd` directory contains very simple command line utilities demonstrating
specific libraries.

## Enjins (be)

The `be` directory contains a number of example Go-Enjin projects demostrating
various features individually. These are all fully working HTTP services which
serve both static and dynamic content.
